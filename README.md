I embarked on a transformative data journey with Texus Electronics, and I'm excited to share the incredible learnings and insights I've gained.
üîç Project Highlights:
‚úÖ Understanding the Power BI Workflow: I delved into the world of data analytics and business intelligence, gaining hands-on experience with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data normalization, and the entire process of transforming raw data into actionable insights.
‚úÖ Primary Keys and Foreign Keys: I discovered the pivotal role of these concepts in maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships within databases.
‚úÖ Fact and Dimension Tables: I learned how to differentiate and strategically leverage these tables to effectively structure data.
‚úÖ ETL and Normalization: I applied these processes to address a real business challenge, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis.
This project not only honed my technical skills but also solidified my belief in the transformative power of data-driven decision-making.
üìà Texus Electronics KPI Dashboard Insights:
My descriptive and diagnostic Texus Electronics KPI dashboards unveils remarkable insights:
üåü Descriptive Dashboard: A compass to uncover customer preferences, product sales by category and country rankings, sales performance, profit margins, and quarterly/monthly sales and revenue trends. Notable discoveries include "smartphones" as top sellers, "TV" as the least purchased item, and "Display" leading in revenue generation. Kenya shines with the highest customer purchases, but we also noticed a dip in overall product sales around May, as depicted in the line chart.
üîç Diagnostic Dashboard: An immersive dive into data exploration equipped with filters, slicers, and interactive elements. It provides the tools to fathom the reasons behind the May sales dip. Closer examination of total items sold by month name and category name highlights the collective decline in three categories (Display, Leisure, and Video) contributing significantly to the overall sales slump in May, as hinted in the descriptive dashboard's line chart.
üåê Global Insights: The diagnostic dashboard reveals intricate relationships between Total Revenue and Total customer purchases by country, unveiled through a scatter chart adorned with colorful clusters. Notable performers include Senegal, Morocco, Ghana, and Nigeria, while Ivory Coast, Burundi, and Angola fall into the lower performance group. Kenya and Egypt shine as outliers with exceptional total customer purchases and revenue performance.
This data journey reaffirms the incredible potential of data analytics and business intelligence in steering informed decision-making.
